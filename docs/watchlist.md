## Clipboard.* requires the STA thread — never call it from Task.Run

WinForms `Clipboard.*` throws `ThreadStateException` on MTA thread-pool threads. The v0.3.0 hot-path split moved the original-clipboard restore into the fire-and-forget `FinalizeAsync` (`Task.Run` → MTA): every **failed** run with a clipboard backup crashed finalize, so (a) the user's clipboard was never restored and (b) the entire `run_completed` + `spellcheck_detail` record was lost — failed runs became invisible and the post-0.3.0 "0% failure rate" was partly an illusion. Only a bare `finalize_failed error_type=ThreadStateException` line remained.

**Current shape:** the restore runs in `RunAsync` on the STA UI thread right after the hot path returns (failed runs only — successful runs keep the corrected text on the clipboard); `FinalizeAsync` does logging only and logs `finalize_failed` with status, active process, and full stack. If you move any `Clipboard.*` call, check which thread it lands on. A `finalize_failed` line in the logs means a run vanished — treat it as a missing-telemetry bug, not noise.

## Capture-failure forensics (open investigation: Notepad / outlook.com bursts)

"Clipboard did not change after Ctrl+C." hit **46% of Notepad runs** (and outlook.com-in-Chrome complaints) across the first 5 weeks of logs. It fails in session bursts — several consecutive hotkey presses all dead, other sessions 100% fine — which retries never recover. Ruled out: admin-elevated Notepad (user confirmed), overlay focus steal (WS_EX_NOACTIVATE), old clipboard lock contention (fixed v0.2.0, commit bc46808). **Root cause not yet proven.**

Since commit 808febb every capture failure carries per-attempt forensics in the `capture_failed` event inside `spellcheck_detail.events[]`:

- `seq_before` / `seq_at_timeout` — clipboard sequence numbers; unchanged means the target app never executed the copy.
- `mods_at_send` / `mods_at_timeout` — physical Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Win/hotkey-key state when Ctrl+C was injected; a modifier still `1` at send means the app saw Ctrl+Alt+C, not Ctrl+C.
- `fg_at_timeout` — `exe=… elevated=0|1|access_denied`; `elevated=1` or `access_denied` means UIPI silently dropped the injected keystrokes.

When the next burst happens, read these fields before theorizing. Reproduce with `--grep-detail` or `--event spellcheck_detail --app <exe>`.

## Velopack bootstrap order

`VelopackApp.Build().Run()` must be the **very first line of `Main`**, before mutex acquisition, WPF initialization, or any other startup code. Velopack installs first-run hooks and restart-after-update logic that must fire before the app does anything else. Moving it down breaks silent updates and first-run setup. This is a hard constraint, not a style preference.

---

## Clipboard / hotkey timing in `SpellcheckCoordinator`

`ClipboardLoop.CaptureSelectionAsync()` waits for hotkey keys to physically release before sending Ctrl+C. Watch for:

- `capture_failed reason="Clipboard did not change after Ctrl+C."` — the key-release wait may have been too short, or the target app didn't respond to Ctrl+C.
- `capture_failed reason="Copied selection was empty."` when text was actually selected — same timing issue, or the app uses a non-clipboard copy path.
- Unexpectedly high `capture_duration_ms`.
- Repeated `copy_attempts=2`.
- `paste_failed` with `expected_process` ≠ `actual_process` — the target app lost focus during the API request; this is not a capture failure, do not treat it as one.

Before adding app-specific timing rules: reproduce with a named target app and inspect the log timing fields. Don't adjust constants blindly. Every capture failure now logs per-attempt forensics — see § Capture-failure forensics at the top of this file.

## Clipboard history exclusion (Win+V)

**Goal:** the corrected text must always be retained in Windows clipboard history; the captured incorrect text should be kept out.

- **Corrected text in history (priority, guaranteed):** the corrected text is written via WinForms `Clipboard.SetText` with no exclusion tag and is the final clipboard state, so the OS history monitor captures it. Do **not** tag the corrected write as transient — that would drop it from history. (Nothing can force inclusion if the user has clipboard history disabled globally; that's an OS setting.)
- **Incorrect text out of history (best-effort):** `ClipboardLoop.ExcludeTextFromHistory` runs right after capture, on the STA thread. It takes clipboard ownership (`OpenClipboard(ownerHwnd)` → `EmptyClipboard` → re-place text → set `CanIncludeInClipboardHistory=0` + `CanUploadToCloudClipboard=0`). The owner HWND must be a **real window** (the hotkey window) — `OpenClipboard(NULL)` + `EmptyClipboard` sets the owner to NULL and makes `SetClipboardData` fail.
- This **races the OS history snapshot** (the source Ctrl+C already produced one untagged update). It wins in practice — this mirrors the proven legacy AHK `SetClipboardHistoryPolicy`. The WinRT `Clipboard.DeleteItemFromHistory` scrub is **not** an option: `GetHistoryItemsAsync` returns `AccessDenied` unless the calling app is foreground, and this tray app never holds focus during a run.
- Every run logs `captured_text_history_excluded=true|false` and an always-on `history_exclude_detail="text=… include=… upload=… cf_include=<id> cf_upload=<id> owner=0x…"`. `include=ok` means the incorrect text was tagged out of history; `include=fail(win32=…)` / `upload=fail(win32=…)` give the exact Win32 error to debug from. `open_clipboard_failed` / `empty_clipboard_failed` mean another process held the clipboard or the owner HWND was invalid.

## Loading overlay UI-thread marshalling

`SetPhase` is called from the async spell-check pipeline (not a UI thread). `OverlayHost` owns a dedicated STA background thread with its own message loop; the form and its Win32 handle are created on that thread at startup and every `SetPhase` is queued onto it via `BeginInvoke`, returning immediately. If you move or defer form/handle creation off that thread, the marshalling breaks and the overlay crashes or silently stops updating.

Phase-to-visibility contract: `Copying` shows the form, `Done` hides it, `Sending`/`Receiving` only swap the label text. `Done` is dispatched in `RunAsync` immediately after the hot path returns — deliberately **before** the original-clipboard restore, which can block for seconds on failed runs while the OS renders the original clipboard formats. Moving the hide after the restore (e.g., back into `FinalizeAsync`) re-introduces an overlay that sticks on screen after failures.

See commits 52b5e27 and 77239cc for the specific WPF-in-WinForms crash sequence the original marshalling fixed.

## WPF-in-WinForms: `System.Windows.Application` must exist

WinForms `Application.Run` does not create `Application.Current` for WPF. Without a `System.Windows.Application` instance:
- `DynamicResource` lookups walk the visual/logical tree and find nothing at the root, resolving to `DependencyProperty.UnsetValue`.
- This crashes at layout time: `'{DependencyProperty.UnsetValue}' is not a valid value for property 'Background'`.
- The `pack://application:,,,/` scheme is also only registered by the Application instance.

**Fix:** `new System.Windows.Application { ShutdownMode = ShutdownMode.OnExplicitShutdown }` instantiated before `Application.Run`, with `Styles.xaml` and `Components.xaml` merged into `app.Resources`.

If you see `wpf_resources_failed` in logs at startup, the dashboard will not work at all. If you see `dashboard_open_failed` or `ui_dispatcher_unhandled` with `DependencyProperty.UnsetValue`, check this anchor before chasing template or binding rewrites.

---

## WPF smoke tests must pump the Dispatcher

`window.Show(); window.Close();` returns before layout, template expansion, and resource resolution run. A smoke test that does only this is a false positive. The `--dashboard-smoke` mode pumps `DispatcherFrame`s for several seconds and hooks `Dispatcher.UnhandledException`. If a smoke test "passes" but the user still sees a crash, distrust the test first.

---

## Hotkey re-registration

`HotkeyWindow.Register()` calls `RegisterHotKey` with `BuildChannel.HotkeyModifiers` and `BuildChannel.HotkeyVk`. If registration fails (throws `Win32Exception`), another process already owns that hotkey combination. Prod owns Ctrl+Alt+U (`0x55`); Dev owns Ctrl+Alt+D (`0x44`). They can coexist. If registration fails for Prod, check whether a legacy AHK instance is still running. Dev failure means another Dev process is already up (check mutex first — that should have caught it).

---

## Mutex collision between channels

`BuildChannel.MutexName` is `"UniversalSpellCheck"` for Prod and `"UniversalSpellCheck.Dev"` for Dev. The mutex is acquired before `SpellCheckAppContext` is created. A second launch of the same channel shows a message box and exits 0 — it cannot get to hotkey registration. Distinct mutex names are what allow Prod and Dev to run side-by-side.

---

## Replacement cache edge cases

- **Same-size fast-edit** — cache key is `mtime + size`. A very fast edit that doesn't change file size can be missed until a subsequent save with a changed size.
- **Read-while-writing** — if the editor writes in two flushes, `TextPostProcessor` may read a partial file and cache it under the final metadata. Potential fix: capture metadata before and after the read, only accept if both match.

Watch `replacements_reload_failed` and `replacements_missing` in logs.

---

## UpdateService skips non-installed builds

`UpdateService.CheckAsync` returns early in two cases — both are correct, neither is a bug:
- Dev channel: `update_check_skipped reason=dev_or_uninstalled` (the entire update flow is disabled in Dev).
- Prod build run via `dotnet run` (no Velopack install metadata): `update_check_skipped reason=not_installed`.

---

## Dashboard auto-open on startup

`SpellCheckAppContext` hooks `Application.Idle` to auto-open the dashboard once on startup. This surfaces WPF failures immediately rather than requiring the user to find the tray menu. Check `dashboard_auto_open_attempt` and subsequent `dashboard_open step=` entries in the log if the dashboard doesn't appear. Step values: `construct` → `show` → `activate` → `done`. A missing `done` with an error after `construct` means the `MainWindow` constructor or XAML initialization threw.

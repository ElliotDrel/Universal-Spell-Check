# src/UI/ — WPF Dashboard

## Grounding

WPF dashboard for the tray app. Opened via the `Open Dashboard` tray menu item. Two pages: **Home** (`ActivityPage` — paginated activity feed with inline diffs) and **Settings** (API key, log folder, replacements). Visual quality matters here — this is the user-facing surface beyond the hotkey itself. The cream tone, card borders, and font stack are intentional and easy to drift on.

## Read first

> **Always read `DESIGN.md` (repo root) before any visual change.** It is the canonical visual contract: colors, fonts, spacing, layout. Then check root `CLAUDE.md` for routing and `docs/architecture.md` § WPF dashboard for pagination and log wiring.

## What's here

```text

|   `-- SettingsPage.xaml.cs
`-- Fonts/                   # Bundled Instrument + JetBrains Mono (embedded in csproj)
```

## Runtime wiring

- The csproj keeps `<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>` for the tray icon, hotkey window, and loading overlay, **and** adds `<UseWPF>true</UseWPF>` for this dashboard.
- `SpellCheckAppContext.ShowSettings()` opens `MainWindow.xaml` in-process.
- `LoadingOverlayForm` (WinForms) stays separate — it's transient spell-check feedback, not dashboard UI.

## Activity feed (data + UX)

- **Logs:** `%LocalAppData%\UniversalSpellCheck\logs\spellcheck-*.jsonl` (unified across channels). Filter via per-line `channel` when needed for tooling; the feed shows all successful runs.
- **Reader:** `NativeActivityLogReader.ReadEntries(30, cursor)` + `ReadAllTimeStats()` in `ActivityPage.xaml.cs`.
- **UI:** Flat rows (time | diff | hover actions), day headers (`TODAY` / `YESTERDAY` / date), all-time stats bar, bottom spinner while paginating.
- **Refresh:** `FeedItems.Children.Clear()` — does not remove `LoadingIndicator` or `EmptyState` hosts.

## Settings (data)

- `SettingsPage.xaml.cs` saves the API key through `SettingsStore`, opens the native log folder, and opens `replacements.json`.

Model selection is persisted through `SettingsStore` and applies to the next request. Hotkey capture remains intentionally disabled.

## Visual verification (after any UI change)

1. **Layout authority:** `DESIGN.md` § Home (Activity) — flat feed + top stats bar (not the two-column `home.png` layout).
2. **Tone reference:** `docs/design-mockups/home.png` and `settings.png` for cream, borders, typography.
3. Confirm the cream tone has not drifted gray.
4. Check font loading. Cambria/Segoe UI fallback on headers means the bundled font is missing.
5. Card borders on Settings should be subtle but visible.

## Manual checks (Activity)

1. Open **Home** — stats show all-time numbers; feed shows newest entries first.
2. Scroll to bottom — spinner appears; older entries append; day headers dedupe across pages.
3. Click **↻ Refresh** — feed and stats reload; scroll-to-load still works afterward.
4. Hover a row — ghost background, copy and ⋮ icons visible.
5. Click diff body or copy — corrected text on clipboard; checkmark feedback on copy icon.
6. On a `text_changed` row, ⋮ → toggle inline vs side-by-side diff.
7. Trackpad scroll feels smooth; mouse wheel scrolls normally.

## Keeping this file current

When pages, runtime wiring, or deferred-control state changes, update this file in the same edit. **If you notice this file or `DESIGN.md` no longer matches what the dashboard actually does, stop and flag it to the user with a proposed fix** — visual drift compounds quickly.
